# Comparative_Analysis_of_PHN_program
A primary focus of public health professionals is to identify and intervene on the social determinants known to have a significant impact on health outcomes for mothers and babies. As such, socio-demographic information such as age group, region, recent immigrant and refugee status, education level, difficulty with income, and, more recently, ethnicity are collected in the public health nursing program and used to determine if pregnant and new parents are offered public health nursing assistance. 

This project focused on a comparative analysis to see if there are demographic differences between individuals that accept, complete, or decline participation in public health nursing programs. The results of this analysis will provide information that can help the public health nursing program determine if certain demographic groups are not accepting or completing services, so targeted interventions may be needed for these groups.
